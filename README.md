* In this project I will be coding a simple recipe website in HTML.
  
* This README will remain blank until I have completed the project or feel there is 
something important worth adding, It will allow me to reflect on what I have learned. 

* After creating a home page and my first full fledged recipe page I feel like my understanding of HTML and git have improved
* Had trouble with a broken link home, figured out it was because I hadn't allocated the parent directory in my code using "../"
* Figured my code would be more readable and easier to follow if I were to use additional lines to prevent horizontal scrolling
* Feeling very psoitive about my progress with this project and I look forward to adding additional features and style as I learn more

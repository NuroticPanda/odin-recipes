        <h3>For the white sauce(bechamel)</h3>

            <li>1.5l milk</li>
            <li>1 onion, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>3 bay leaves</li>
            <li>3 cloves, garlic</li>

            <li>good grating of nutmeg</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
        <h3>Step one</h3>
            <p>
                First, make the béchamel sauce. Put the milk, onion, bay leaves and cloves into a large saucepan<br> and bring very gently just up to the boil. Turn off the heat and set aside for 1 hr to infuse.
            </p>
        <h3>Step two</h3>
            <p>
                For the meat sauce, put the oil, celery, onion, carrot, garlic and pancetta in another large saucepan.<br> Gently cook together until the veg is soft but not coloured.
            </p>
        <h3>Step three</h3>
            <p>
                Tip in the beef and pork mince, the milk and chopped tomatoes. Using a wooden spoon, stir together and <br>break up and mash the lumps of mince against the sides of the pan. When the mince is mostly broken down,<br> stir in all the herbs, the stock cubes and the red wine, and bring to a simmer. Cover and cook for 1 hr,<br> stirring occasionally to stop the bottom catching.
            </p>
        <h3>Step four</h3>
            <p>
                Uncover and gently simmer for another 30 mins-1 hr until the meat is tender and saucy. Taste and season.
            </p>
        <h3>Step five</h3>
            <p>
                To finish the béchamel sauce, strain the milk through a fine sieve into one or two jugs.<br> Melt the butter in the same pan then, using a wooden spoon, mix in the flour and cook for 2 mins.
            </p>
        <h3>Step six</h3>
            <p>
                Stir in the strained milk, a little at a time – the mix will thicken at first to a doughy paste, but keep going,<br> adding milk gradually to avoid lumps. <br>Bring to a gentle simmer, stirring constantly (if you have lumps,<br> give it a quick whisk).<br> Gently bubble for a few minutes until thickened. Season with salt, pepper and a good grating of nutmeg.
            </p>
        <h3>Step seven</h3>
            <p>
                Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Spread a spoonful of the meat sauce over the base of a roughly 3.5-litre baking dish.<br> Cover with a single layer of dried pasta sheets, snapping them to fit if needed, then top with a quarter of the béchamel.<br> Spoon over a third of the meat sauce and scatter over a little of the parmesan.
            </p>
        <h3>Step eight</h3>
            <p>
                Repeat the layers – pasta, béchamel, meat and parmesan – two more times to use all the meat sauce.<br> Add a final layer of pasta, the last of the béchamel and remaining parmesan.<br> Sit the dish on a baking tray to catch spills and bake for 1 hr until bubbling, browned and crisp on top.
